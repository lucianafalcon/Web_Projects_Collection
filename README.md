  <br>

Restaurant order management system that allows users to select menu items,
create an order, and generate an order summary including a unique order number
and total price.

## Overview
The application models a complete ordering workflow, from product selection
to order confirmation. Menu data is structured in a custom JSON model, enriched
from external APIs, and used as the source of truth for all business logic.

The focus of this project is on data modeling, order processing, and system logic.

## Key Features
- Menu and category management
- Order creation and cart management
- Unique order number generation
- Total price calculation and validation
- Integration with external REST APIs for food images
- Data normalization into a custom JSON model
- Asynchronous data handling and error management

## System Logic
The system processes orders by validating selected items, calculating totals,
and generating an order summary, closely mirroring backend order-processing logic.

## Tech Stack
- JavaScript
- HTML / CSS
- JSON-based data modeling
- REST API consumption

## Deployment
- Deployed on Vercel in a production-like environment
- Continuous deployment from GitHub

## Purpose
This project demonstrates backend-oriented thinking, including data modeling,
order processing, and API integration, implemented in a client-side environment.
and integration patterns are directly transferable to backend services.
